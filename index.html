        <p>With the idea of imparting programming
            knowledge, Mr. Sandeep Jain, an IIT
            Roorkee alumnus started a dream,
            GeeksforGeeks. Whether programming
            excites you or you feel stifled,
            wondering how to prepare for
            interview questions or
            how to ace data structures and
            algorithms, GeeksforGeeks is a
            one-stop solution. With every
            tick of time, we are adding arrows
            in our quiver. From articles on
            various computer science subjects
            to programming problems for practice,
            from basic to premium courses, from
            technologies to entrance examinations,
            we have been building ample content
            with superior quality. In a short
            span, we have built a community of
            1 Million+ Geeks around the world, 20,000+
            Contributors and 500+ Campus Ambassadors
            in various colleges across the nation.
            Our success stories include a lot of
            students who benefitted in their
            placements and landed jobs at tech
            giants. Our vision is to build a gigantic
            network of geeks and we are only a
            fraction of it yet.</p>
